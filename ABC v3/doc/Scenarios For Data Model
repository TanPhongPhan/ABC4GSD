Fact:
Atm the management of entities inside abc4gsd is performed through the management application

1. user creates it's own activity and loads ContactList 
   - the activity must contain only himself and ContactList

2. user creates it's own activity and loads Eclipse 
   - the activity must contain only himself and Eclipse (heavy)

3. user creates it's own activity and loads Eclipse 
   - the activity must contain only himself and Eclipse (heavy)

4. user switches between 1., 2. and 3. and apps are killed and relunchd only if not present in the resumed activity. In which case are just reinitialized

5. user adds user B to activity 2. and shares all apps
   - user B is notified and when resumes 3. apps are shared in a shallow way



1. User is already part of the system
   - Activity is created
     - Ecology created
     - State created
   - Real Application is created for coding Java
     - and it is wrapped by Application 
   - Application is connected to the ecology
   - Properties are created (NO ... only by resuming app)

   - What is the state about? (Initialized/Suspended/Resumed/Terminated?)
   - What is the application/user property about?
   - What does the Real Application contain?
